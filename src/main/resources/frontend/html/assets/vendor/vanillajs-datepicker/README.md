# Vanilla JS Datepicker

A vanilla JavaScript remake of [bootstrap-datepicker](https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker) for [Bulma](https://bulma.io) and other CSS frameworks  

This package is written from scratch as ECMAScript modules/[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) stylesheets to reproduce similar usability to bootstrap-datepicker.  
It can work either standalone or with CSS framework (e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Foundation](https://get.foundation)), but works best with [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as it's developed primarily for Bulma. 

The package also includes pre-built js/css files for those who like to use it directly on browser.

### Features

- Date picker (input-dropdown, inline), date range picker
- Keyboard operation support (navigation by arrow keys, editing on input field)
- i18n support (locales, CSS-based text direction detection)
- Easily customizable to adapt stylesheet for various CSS frameworks
- Dependency free
- Made for modern browsers — no IE support
- Lightweight (well, relatively…) — 33kB (minified, uncompressed)
